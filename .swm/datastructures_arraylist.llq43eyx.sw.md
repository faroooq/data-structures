count - To keep track of number of items in the array.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/com/data/arrays/ArrayList.java
```java
13             for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
14                 System.out.println(items[i]);
15             }
```

<br/>

Adding items to the items array
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/com/data/arrays/ArrayList.java
```java
19             items[count++] = item;
```

<br/>

*   We can't remove the item which is < 0, bcs index start from zero.

*   We can't remove the item which is >= available count of items in the array.

```java
23             if (index < 0 || index >= count) {
24                 throw new IllegalArgumentException();
25             }
```

Below logic performs SHIFT OPERATION.

Shift the items to the left to fill the hole or gap.\[10, 30, 40, 60\]

If the input is to remove the 1st index, then the items in the array will perform shift operation from right to left. \[10, 40, 60\]

```java
27             for (int i = index; i < count; i++) {
28                 items[i] = items[i + 1];
29             }
```

We are making count--, means removing the last index which doesn't have any value.
